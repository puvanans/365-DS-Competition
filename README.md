## 365-DS-Competition

This repository is based on data from 365 Data Science (an online learning platform), which was part of a competition conducted by 365 DS.
I learned of this competition and dataset days before the deadline and couldn't compete. But, the data interested me, and hence, this project.

The data was about students of 365 DS from around the world and different aspects of their interaction with the platform.

I analyzed a large portion of the data, but only shared on two topics. I made two distinct projects out of these topics.

They are:
 - Time series analysis on membership purchase, student registration, and student engagement.
 - Similarity of engagement between the top 5 represented countries (In process).
 
This repository contains the entirety of analysis, but only the relevant files will be hyperlinked to portfolio and other places.

This README will not explain the entire code base to save time. However, most of the individual files have markdown documenting my reasoning. And in future projects I will be documenting as I analyze.

For any further questions, please reach out to me. My bio contains my Linkedin.
