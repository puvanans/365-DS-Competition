## 365-DS-Competition

This repository is based on data from 365 Data Science (an online learning platform), which was part of a competition conducted by 365 DS.
I learned of this competition and dataset days before the deadline. But, the data interested me, and hence, this project.

The dataset contained information on students and apsects of their interaction.

I analyzed much of the data, but only shared on two topics. I considered these two topics to be distinct projects.

They are:
 - Time series analysis on membership purchase, student registration, and student engagement.
 - Similarity of engagement between the top 5 represented countries (In process).
 
This repository contains the entirety of analysis, but only the relevant files will be hyperlinked to portfolio and other places.

At the moment, I will not be writing documentation for the entire code base to save time. However, going forward I will be documenting as I analyze.

For any further questions, please reach out to me. My bio contains my Linkedin.
